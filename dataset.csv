I finally got my hands on the highly anticipated Framework 13 laptop and built it from the ground up. While the concept of a fully upgradeable and repairable laptop is exciting, the reality left me with mixed feelings about its value proposition. In this video, I break down the pros and cons of the Framework 13, exploring whether its modularity justifies its premium price tag and older hardware.

Ugw9Bup5p_uJbbKtBF94AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqIMu4C87SM&lc=Ugw9Bup5p_uJbbKtBF94AaABAg,"1,5 years ago I decided in favor of buying a Yoga 7. Now I have multiple cracks on the plastic bezel around the screen and the plastic is shattered around both hinges. Even though I'm not a heavy duty user and mainly use it at home. Warranty repair denied claiming its due to physical damage (no it's not). Paying for the repair from my pocket, which requires replacing the entire screen section, would cost 70% of the original purchase cost.

Looking around I could hardly find any matte 2,8K display laptops on the market where I live and I'm aiming for that due to switching to Linux and needing a display without fractional scaling. The only other options I was able to find are a couple of Lenovos - Ideapad Pros and Yoga 7 Slims - priced between $1100-1400. Or some Lenovo T14s around $2200. Compared to these the Framework is not a bad deal at all, especially factoring in the repairability.

The only valid downside I agree with is the rounded corners on the screen offered only with squared bezels. I mean it just seems so straightforward to create bezels with the same rounded corners around the edges that I can't even fathom why Framework hasn't been doing it.",UCFLih6JxO5A3a-Km8jOz8ag,FqIMu4C87SM

Ugzam9t8CyaJNw1APhZ4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqIMu4C87SM&lc=Ugzam9t8CyaJNw1APhZ4AaABAg,"He’s ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, so why have I paid my final payment for the even more expensive Intel Core Ultra version?

It’s because he underestimates the true value proposition that the Framework 13 offers.

Firstly, he’s misunderstood the true cost: all he talks about is the upfront cost, when it’s the savings on upgrade that redress the balance. 

E.g. to upgrade to the Ryzen 5 motherboard in his video it costs just $419.  This gives an indication as to what I can expect in future…that’s a bargain!!  Plus, as Framework grows in popularity, economies of scale should push the price down.

Secondly, when you upgrade your motherboard, you can repurpose your old motherboard eg as a server and there are free downloadable 3D printer case designs for Framework motherboards. 

Therefore, upon upgrading I get TWO computers not one new one…you need to add in the price of a free secondhand computer/server into the equation.

Thirdly, computers break..it’s a fact of life and the cost of repair is negligible with Framework compared to any other brand…and some brands are impossible to repair which means you have to replace the ENTIRE LAPTOP.  This huge cost is missing from his analysis.

Fourthly, he doesn’t properly factor the value of recycling and waste prevention…he’s just another mindless consumer who moans about the environment but does nothing about it even when the solution is in his hands.  The cognitive dissonance is palpable but he dismisses it. 

Lastly, as a Linux user, it’s fantastic to have a brand that’s put support of Linux as a primary goal.",UCKV8JQSt05WScc2wWqvSsqw,FqIMu4C87SM

Yeah, I highly doubt they can get as early access to the parts needed to design for the newest generation cpus much less fully design, fab up, and have it on sell. This argument while I get it sucks to not have the latest is the kind that simply dings a smaller company for not being the shitty giant entrenched company that has existed for decades. Note 2. Laptops SUCK. The only laptop I've found so far that doesn't feel crappy to use is the surface laptop which starts at about $1,200.

Being able to upgrade is great. Until it is the best option compared to the competition, with all other things being equal, it will continue to be a hard sell. Props to Framework for being one of the first to offer what enthusiasts have been asking for, just hopefully eventually they're able to get to a future where they can price in line with other manufacturers, and hopefully other manufacturers follow suit with this model as well.

If you bump your ram, storage, and screen back down on the framework to actually match the yoga and the price someone would realistically pay, the delta isn't as bad as you make it out to be.

Not saying the still ~$300 premium isn't significant, but I don't think it's too unfair a price to pay for something that will be able to theoretically stay around a lot longer and not be completely replaced when I want to upgrade in a couple years. That yoga is almost entirely irreparable too. You break anything on it and it's essentially waste.

In my eyes, you buy the initial unit for 300 more, upgrade two years later like you likely would for the yoga at ~$400 like you mentioned, and you've already broken even.

As a framework user, I found your points thought-provoking, thank you for sharing. <br><br>From what i understood, your main points were 3:<br><br>1. durability and longevity is better than and should be prioritized over repairability;<br>2. Unused products can be sold refurbished or recycled by OEMs, so don&#39;t necessarily produce e-waste;<br>3. Only a niche minority group care about repairability and upgradability, and this attitude seems to be inconsistent. <br><br>Is this a fair understanding? I&#39;ll proceed assuming so.<br><br>First, regarding e-waste, I&#39;ve actually read that it&#39;s really hard to fully recycle devices. Specifically what i was reading is that Apple, who have the lead, is able to recycle 60-80% of their iphones, only because they&#39;ve invested loads into this and because they have only a small selection of models... <br><br>Second, regarding upgradability, the issues i run into old devices go beyond ram and storage. Batteries fail, screen technology improves, usb ports break, keyboard keys get stuck... The appeal of a machine like framework is that you can repair or upgrade almost every individual part without needing to ship your laptop away or pay a technician or pay for parts you don&#39;t really need replaced... Lenovo, Dell and other companies don&#39;t allow for this. They also don&#39;t allow for CPU upgrades. Why do i need a new keyboard, chassy, speakers, and screen if I just want a more powerful CPU? What about standard upgrades (e.g. you can&#39;t install a ddr5 ram on an old laptop that only supports ddr4)... The list goes on. <br><br>I agree that this isn&#39;t something someone&#39;s parents would necessarily care about. But businesses? Perhaps... <br><br>Lastly, though, and most importantly, Framework is trying their hardest to make the upgrades and repairs accessible to everyone. My dad got into engineering by taking apart things like TVs, radios, caset players, and putting them back together. This is no longer possible. People have become entirely dependent on the benevolence of OEMs and companies. It&#39;s demoralizing, disempowering, and a hindrance to meaningful learning... <br><br>I agree, realistically, probably nobody will care. But I hope framework computers are able to encourage people to open up their devices for the first time and have a poke around, even if they never would have normally dared. I&#39;m sure as heck not risking breaking the water sealing on my phone trying to get it open, or breaking sth because i didn&#39;t melt the binding glue properly... <br><br>As for the durability vs repairability point, I don&#39;t have any thoughts beyond wondering if the two really are mutually exclusive...",UC1Icl5Sw7fj08b5MhFMS3Sg,UgzZfj9qUlvE-9S-QvZ4AaABAg

Yet, I found Andy&#39;s argument that it&#39;s better to have durable things quite thought-provoking, personally. <br><br>So, I was wondering if you were willing to share why you felt it was a &quot;stupid&quot; take? <br><br>I agree that all things are bound to fail at some point, and being able to get in and fix it yourself significantly extends its life. But beyond that i am struggling to marshal my thoughts... Does this come at the expense of durability? Does advocating for repairability give companies an excuse to become sloppy with their quality? Obviously needing to swap out something constantly because it&#39;s low quality isn&#39;t good either... <br><br>I don&#39;t know, looking for thoughts :)",UC1Icl5Sw7fj08b5MhFMS3Sg,UgzZfj9qUlvE-9S-QvZ4AaABAg

Planned obsolescence IS a thing, and Apple is a prime example of this. Whether or not their products are durable and high quality is irrelevant because, as with all tech, things WILL break. And WHEN they break, they are impossible to fix. Framework proved, in their very first generation product (which the FW13 was), that if they could make a user-repairable laptop for only a small price premium, manufacturers a hundred times larger than them with access to economies of scale have no excuse NOT to. The only reason OEMs don&#39;t make high-quality equipment that can be self-repaired - regardless of product category, be it cars, laptops, phones, washers, even CLOTHING - is because they don&#39;t want to. It&#39;s as simple as that. If they did, they could sell it at an obscene price and it would STILL make money. The OEMs simply don&#39;t want YOU to be able to dig into your own property.

It is a work in progress, and Apple is getting closer to its 2030 deadline of being carbon neutral and having less e-waste. I prefer companies to take this approach rather than the Framework model, which ultimately will lead to lower profits, less investment and a lack of innovation.<br><br>Other parts failing: I have been using computers for forty years, and this has not happened more than a couple of times, and that was way back when. Reliability and durability are now excellent, assuming you care for your device. My original iPad still works!<br><br>I stand by my thoughts on &quot;who cares?&quot;. There is a demographic we see in comments all the time that loves opening up their device and playing around with it. However, the average person wants it to work out of the box and the cost to be reasonable. So, the price of the Framework is the problem. For example, most of my family have 8+ year old PCs that cost under £600. They will never need to upgrade their RAM, storage, or even the chip for their light work.<br><br>I hope Framework can prosper for the people who love the lifestyle, but I feel that to make profits, it will never be a value option.

It's the Fairphone of laptops, meant for you to buy into an ecosystem of parts and guides and sustainability. You're signing up for years' worth of support and tons of other things (including the free CAD files for most of the hardware).
If you're criticizing the price and talking about how there should be newer, fresher tech in their machines, the point is lost on you. They're constantly putting out new mainboards and shipping as fast as they presumably can; they're making 100% repairable devices designed with the technical user in mind; they're giving the users all the choices in the world when it comes to a laptop.
I'd say the price is entirely fair for that. Parts quality might have room for improvement, but that's not really what you talk about much here, is it?

Don't forget those repairs are not free. If the motherboard breaks, that's another $600 for a new one or $300 for a previous gen. You're $1300 machine is now $1600-1900.

What's really telling is the people dunking on this video don't own a Framework themselves ... and I'd bet real money the primary reason is because of how expensive it is.

also I dunno, maybe we really dont know the real cost of a laptop is when the company is paying their employees a proper wage
also are we still in a chip shortage?

I am not a computer enthusiast, and I love my framework. Here is my criteria for a good laptop:

- I only do very light computing task on my laptop, and I want good battery life, so U chip is actually an advantage for me, compare to the HS chip.
- I want my laptop to have minimal environmental impact. It should be long-lasting and produces minimal e-wastes.
- I want my laptop to have excellent Linux support, since I do not enjoy tinkering with my computers (happy to say, never `demsg`ed on my framework!)
- I want a knowledgeable support community that actually knows about computers, so that if anything actually failed, I know I can resolve it in a couple of days at most.
- I want long-term and easy firmware update for security. 
- If possible, I would prefer a nice screen.

I think my requirement embodies basically what ""non-enthusiast"" wants: ""just works"", good battery life, great support, basic security, and climate conscious. And this basically rules out most laptops out there. Most major laptop brands like Dell, HP and Lenovo all have terrible phone tree, and good luck finding anyone that actually knows what they are doing. Many of them also don't support automatic firmware update. I am not going to search for the firmware and flash it every month, that is simply not what a ""non-enthusiast"" would do.
In the end, the only manufactures that come close to framework are system76 and tuxedo. I eventually chose framework because of its nice 3:2 display, the upgradable CPU, and the U instead of HS processor.

Quite ironically, I believe Austin dislikes the framework precisely because he is an ""enthusiast"", he knows the performance differences between every laptop, and their value propositions. I personally would much prefer to not waste time in a phone tree or go on to dell forum, just to know that they are not able to fix my issue blah blah blah. With a framework, you know that all the hardware will work on Linux, with long-term support; and if anything fails, there is a huge and knowledgeable community that can help me fix it quickly.

The fact that Apple is one of the largest laptop manufacture, before their ARM transition, is a clear signal that consumers, especially non-enthusiasts like me, prefers a computer that works, instead of min-maxing on all the values on a laptop that will not be supported after a year.

Framework is a small company and can only buy a small (compared to an HP or Lenovo) batch of parts. If you buy 5,000 brand new ryzen processors, AMD might sell them for, lets say $150 each. Hoewever, if you are a large company like HP, you may be buying 500,000 and AMD might be selling them for $75 each (all numbers made up since I'm not a parts buyer for a large company...). Now extrapolate that out to every single part in the laptop plus research, design, marketing, etc. and of course you'll be paying a premium for a smaller company's product. It comes down to is it worth it to you to support that company and their goals.

For that price and the cost for upgrading the parts is similar to just buy a new laptop, No CHANCE, even with the argument ""framework is for the enthusiast and the repairability is up on the roof"", it'll be a REASONABLE device/laptop to purchase, in terms of price to performance (lets face it, this is still important for everyone). All the problem here is in the price, i mean Framework is still considered new after all. I think it just needs time. 

BUT if they really want this product to NOT compete with a greater market (a market where people use laptop for work, including designing, editing, etc.), facing ASUS, LENOVO, etc. and they 100% focused for the enthusiast and tech fans (and/or developers, engineers), then yeah, putting a high price on that advantage and the uniqueness of that product is super ACCEPTABLE.",UCYXHwqOkR-5pcM0pDGos1gw,FqIMu4C87SM

I just think that the angle of constantly upgrading your laptop isn't always viable for some of us, that we'd have to make the best with what we've got, and just having a laptop that's very easy to fix (both the labor and the parts to do so) can be an arguably better investment than just getting a cheaper laptop and realizing you happened to grab a laptop that's difficult to repair and realize you need to grab a new one, like I'd rather fork up the money upfront due to a variety of reasons

It costs more money compared to other laptops even if you want to upgrade some of the main components like CPU or GPU It's hard to sell your old one cause first it is only compatible with framework-specific laptops and second most of the buyers had already similar specs beside the small community of people who might buy it, so it would be cheaper to sell your laptop and purchase other one with new GPU or CPU.

But I would have liked to see some effort into diving into the ethos of the company's product (laptop) he is reviewing on, and who the actual audience for that is. They market their laptop for everyone because even if one didn't intend to have a laptop that lasts, and reduce E-waste, they would be contributing towards a better cause while also getting an okay system, and now the tech has evolved over the years - having an Okay system is all most people need including the average joe. Students, not so much like me :)
 (I am really tempted though)

The point of having that CPU upgrade is not so you can buy it every 6 months to be up to date, but to have a new system 4 years down the line to a higher spec, without adjusting to a new laptop with their own bios system, instabilities and quirks. If I own a car, I want to Own that and not be thinking like replacing the whole thing because something is cheaper to buy as a whole then just maintaining it - economics sense? ye maybe but you have to again adjust to it, get your muscle memory build over time. Besides the goal of Framework is entirely different from the market and they even standing close to competing, and desirable I might add? It is just awesome to be a part of it.

Apple ffs have been doing this since forever, people justifying the prices saying, it's for R&D, the software upgrade, the consistency and they all but given us laptops with no ports, keyboards that breaks, display that dies for no user error AT ALL. People still backed that up because of familiarity and the software ecosystem unison with their hardware (dongles and whatever but it works as the user expects) but then again, they were also being held hostage by that same company.

Whatever framework is doing is by choice, the pricing is by choice while also trying their best to price for the competition despite being a low volume manufacturer. And the users are trying prop them up to have that ecosystem last and prosper till it becomes a no brainer to stick to framework and just wait for a newer hardware that just makes sense to upgrade.

I didn't even mention about the saying the environment thing because frankly most people cannot justify buying specifically for that cause only because most can't afford that premium. If that was the case, then it would make sense for framework to never upgrade their hardware design and just bulk order just the motherboard and have that be updated every 6 months. And that is just as sad as buying a whole new laptop imo, because that ain't really solving the core cause either.",UCi2HVcVYMhRLuTnt-BJYyzQ,FqIMu4C87SM

I love my framework but it definitely does have problems that I'd like to see someone talk about. That said this review really missed the mark there. I took my laptop from a 4 core 11th gen i5 to a ryzen 7 7840u while I got to keep using the rest of the machine that I still liked. I was able to turn that old main board into a server and use my thin and light laptop to play triple a games at friends houses months after it struggled with some indie stuff. It's not the cheapest thing out there but I'd rather pay more for a system that is not only meant to last, but is also coming from a company with a strong environmental focus. All of the packaging is recyclable. Not getting a brand new laptop every few years means less batteries that I have to take care of to get new tech. Yes the fans are annoying and I would like to see them improved. I'd love to see a touch screen option come out, and it's a bit annoying how long it can take for upgrades to come out, but to me it's worth it for a one of a kind laptop that I feel good about buying, using, and not having to worry about. The hinges on my laptop got loose over time, and for $20 and 15 minutes of my time that is fixed, which you really can't do with any other laptop out there. Framework has problems, but the pros outweigh the cons to their target audience, so next time just please try and see it from our perspective.",UC88NtNVghlHsv7iQTsR55jg,FqIMu4C87SM

It’s clear Austin didn’t fully understand what the Framework Laptop is all about. And before anyone says I’m biased, I don’t even own one and can’t currently afford it, but this review feels completely wrong to me.

Framework is about more than selling another laptop—it’s about sustainability, upgradability, and giving power back to the user. Sure, you might upgrade your laptop every year or two, but good luck getting a new battery or replacing a broken USB port on most mainstream laptops. With Framework, those issues are a non-issue.

I’m not even going to get started on companies like Dell with their awful design choices—two Type-C ports only? Seriously? And if you want more RAM, you have to buy the higher storage model, which just hikes up the cost. Comparing the 'cheapest' orange to the 'cheapest' apple (fruit, not the company) is just plain wrong. They’re in completely different categories.

Yes, the Framework might seem expensive, but that’s partly because they’re still growing and don’t have the massive market share to negotiate lower component prices. But here’s the thing—with Framework, you have the freedom to shop around for cheaper SSDs and RAM, and upgrade your laptop the way *you* want, without being locked into overpriced 'upgrade' options.",UCQF7KZbWecxKXyldaOzTD4g,FqIMu4C87SM

While I am happy to see you having a look, you are looking at the Framework laptop like it is just another laptop and not giving the proper spotlight it deserves. 

The laptop is a different kind of laptop that aims for longevity, repairability and upgradability. You can swap out a lot of parts (the main board, the RAM, storage, even the battery) and even upgrade them (For example, I am planning to swap from a 11th Gen Intel to the AMD board). You dont show updraging the board. 

The new screen's rounded corners are indeed a drawback, but looks minor to me. Thing is they either had the choice to get a squared cornered screen but make it more expensive or go with that pre made model for cheaper, and the latter was the selected choice. Blame bigger companies for making this design popular. 

To me, having a laptop being repairable AND upgradeable is something I love, even if I have to sacrifice some things.

I hope you can remake this review to shows the potential it has rather than comparing it to another laptop for performance and price, because that is not what Framework is about. They are rebuilding the path that bigger companies have abandoned for years.",UCZqJYhZIo_CsbdARCaeF0yw,FqIMu4C87SM

And as someone that has been looking in the farthest corners for a laptop that suits me and my needs, I have looked at this Lenovo already, and the specs are horribly misleading on the product page.

The Lenovo you showed had the following specs (model: 83DK000DUS, Model number shown at 16:54)
 - Ryzen 5 8640HS (a little bit quicker than the Ryzen 5 7640U, sure)
 - 8GB of completely non-upgradeable RAM (Yes, I double-checked, you need to order enough when you buy it, Lenovo explicitly lists it as Soldered LPDDR5)

 - a 512GB SSD (likely a cheaper offering than those from Framework, which are WD Black model drives, the SN770 or SN850X)
 - a ""2k"" display, bonus being touch (Lenovo lists it as a 1920x1200 300nit 60Hz IPS panel, which is NOT even close to the 2.8k 2880x1920 500nit 120HZ display you got on the Framework)
 - The Lenovo is a 2-in-1 model which IS a bonus, sure
 - You compared the Lenovo at its sale price, of $450, which it is no longer on sale and is $750

So, a better comparison would be an HP Pavilion Plus 14Z-EY100 with the 1TB upgrade, which has an MSRP of $1120 for the Ryzen 5 with 16GB of RAM and a 2560x1600 120hz IPS 300nit display or $1260 for the Ryzen 7 with 16GB of RAM and the 2880x1800 120hz 400-500nit OLED display, I am sure there are other similar comparisons, but it is one I have found during my searching.

I love the content Austin but please make sure your due diligence is done for something like this, as the Framework and Lenovo are in completely different categories (a higher end version of the same Lenovo model would make a better comparison instead). I feel very as though the view taken here was very skewed to which I can say I am very disappointed, but I still look forward to future videos.",UCd3nQwIEjmUAEihlTCipXOw,FqIMu4C87SM

The framework allows you to buy a replacement motherboard, and drop that straight into your existing chassis.

In my opinion, the price should not be viewed as ""oh this is just another Windows laptop"". Every single part can be replaced, and to add to this it's entirely open source. That means there's at least partial schematics for every component, which is good news for third party hardware/software!

First of all the DIY Edition ist NOT cheaper than the prebuilt one IF you buy all your parts from frameworks. This is not made clear on the website but the price that was shown in the video for the DIY Version does not inclued all the neccessary parts while the predbuild version does. If you get the DIY Version you should get your own RAM, storage and OS as Framework charges a significant premium for these. The price difference actually makes sense because they have to build all laptops for quality control. The DIY versions are actually disassembled after that so they require more work. 

Also the value of these laptops is not in the specs but in the repairebility and upgradebility. If you want the most perfomance per dollar this is simply not the laptop for you. There are tons of options that offer these. But there is bearely any (if any at all) other laptops that do offer what the framework does. And there are a lot of people that value repairibility an upgradebility over pure performance. There are already some manufactures that implement more rapairible designs in their laptops but as far as i know none of them go as far as framework with the concept. Right now they still offer a very unique product.

They're not trying to compete by pushing out new laptops every year with the latest tech. Instead, they’re focused on giving us a laptop that lasts—a device you can upgrade over time without breaking the bank.

In a world where replacing a screen on a $500 laptop can cost almost half of its value, or where a tiny issue with soldered components means tossing the whole laptop, Framework is a game-changer. It’s awesome to know you can have a laptop that you can tweak and upgrade as you need, rather than being stuck with whatever you bought.

There are really two types of laptop users: those who get a new one every 2-3 years and those who invest in something that’ll last. I’m definitely in the latter camp. I used a MacBook Pro from 2017 until 2022, and while it served me well, it became unusable due to battery issues. The cost to replace the battery was so high that buying a new laptop seemed like a better option. That’s where Framework comes in—if they can keep delivering reasonably priced upgrades, they might just be the future we’ve all been waiting for.

I wish the video had taken a closer look at how Framework is delivering on its promises. The only way they can compete with the big brands is if more people get on board, and negative reviews might scare off those who are curious about trying something new.",UCBmH1HR_MVg44iH0-_qQimw,FqIMu4C87SM

People with OCD who wants flexibility on locations of their ports.  2. usually cheap laptop has to cut corners liked, batteries, screen viewing angle or resolution, onboard memories, keyboard/trackpad, etc.  Although, I don't own a framework laptop but I believe their parts are at least on par or above average.  So using a cheap laptop as alternative is not too fair.  3. People needs to stay on relatively new CPUs.  For example, developers, editors, etc.?   So instead of getting new laptops, they only need to switch out parts and no need to get used to with a new laptop layout (I hate manufactures never keep the same keyboard layout).    Framework is not for me because I don't swap laptop often enough.  My main daily machine is an 8 year old desktop.  However, I do like their concept.

The old motherboard could be used on more things aside from a straight up pc. You could literally turn it into a router, install pfsense in it and it’ll have more security than any prebuilt routers like tp link and net gear both of which offers a subscription service just for added security which is absurd. That’s just one example. Clearly this isn’t the laptop for you I can agree with that but you got to take into account other peoples interest as well. The motherboard in these laptops is not just for a pc. It’s literally a more powerful version of a raspberry pi. You can turn this thing into a router as mentioned earlier, nas storage station, a console and more. If you got a bleeding edge laptop and the screen breaks and it’s out of warranty, but the motherboard and everything else works, are you gonna just throw it away or have it repaired. Repairing a proprietary part is expensive and you might as well buy a new laptop. A new screen with this is just a fraction of the price. Also batteries degrade over time. What are people gonna do when their MacBooks only last 15 mins on a single charge. Upgrade? But the laptop still works it’s just has to be plugged in more often. Here you could just replace it.

1. He mentions the repairability but doesn't mention how easy it is to get parts for them instead of relying on 3rd party like his Yoga choice will be if he has to get a new screen.
2. He mentions the upgrade path to new parts but doesn't mention how you can also upgrade the whole board to a newer compatible board, without having to buy a WHOLE new laptop, and then being able to use the older board with DIY solutions.
3. He tries to pin Framework as a system that has to be sold to the open consumer market at BB and other establishments but fails to forget that this brand is mostly aimed to the audience who wants control on what can be done with their system now and in the future.
He is making lots of points to show that this is great for a laptop but hates the higher price tag, but just tries to push against it like it needs to step up.
I would rather side with the Framework group and allowing a few fans in their systems than the tiny single fan that HP tries to push on the masses.

Last time I dropped my xiaomi mi 11, I sadly not only broke the glass but the display under it as well. I got the phone through a carrier for about 450,  and the repair cost was 300,  give or take. What I decided to do instead is put my phone on the second hand market for 100$ and get a new phone and get it insured (fold 4 because the inner screen was about 600$ by itself). A guy had a faulty board and bought my phone and combined it with his phone and repaired his faulty board for just 100$. This way waste was minimized. If you buy an expensive device you will be more willing to repair it only because of the price. The lower the price gets, the better to find someone else willing to reuse the device. Sorry, but to save the environment, I&#39;m not willing to live in a world where if you are poor, you only get to use second-hand devices. New cheap  devices are only available because some of them are usually so bad that their lifespan is usually lower if you want the latest and greatest. I&#39;m not advocating for those devices that are e-waste out of the box , but devices that are viable for 1-3 years that are cheap are not something I&#39;m against. But we are talking about a cheap feeling laptop that&#39;s better even in performance for a lower price .... not exactly an e waste product. Also to say being environmentally friendly is expensive, means it&#39;s something only rich people could do. 😅 well, most people are not rich, so it&#39;s logical that we as a society have more e-waste.",UCNHegwzCJ0ZZHG3fdbwyOJQ,UgzcQoPUj-Sx7LUIral4AaABAg

- Most countries don’t get the crazy sales the US have, where you can get a well-built laptop like the Yoga 7 for US$500. They usually go for US$900-1000 up here in Canada (worse in other markets), so $1200 for a Framework doesn’t sound that outrageous at all. 

- Many Framework customers, who are probably somewhat tech literate, aren’t buying the RAM, SSD, chargers, etc with Framework — but are instead getting them cheaper through other retailers when there’s a sale, getting them used, etc.

- As someone who helped with managing IT in a small business before, the fact that you can obtain Framework parts easily on their website is attractive for maintaining the company’s fleet of laptops. Other manufacturers just don’t make parts available except to corporate customers who have huge IT departments. 

- In terms of customization, being able to customize the ports and the keyboard layout / language is hugely convenient. If you type in multiple languages, the only other manufacturer that offers alternative keyboard options is Apple.

- For an ultrabook, where you’re realistically doing office work or some light photo / video editing, having the latest processor doesn’t matter that much? 12th-14th Intel all share the same architecture with some minor spec bump, for example…

- Lastly, I really don’t get the comparison with custom keyboards. The customer who wants a complete laptop for $500 are probably buy $20 keyboards…not the insane custom keyboards this channel often features…",UClkMpfR-l4OmN3-6OpSrzIw,FqIMu4C87SM

Combine that with the fact that if you don't a big lot of CPUs you get a shitty deal on price. Combine that with if you don't sell within volume you don't get quick access to the latest products. Combine with the fact that AMD tend to focus on Desktop, Console and Server (aka their moneymakers) their little amount of laptop chips they bother to make.

so you have mikes mother and possibly father who would be william, and vanessa is his first kid and a year later he has mike, but vannessa got hiden from mike, and i think that gemma and darlin are williams kids with mikes mother and then mikes mother cheated on william with the henry from this universe, and has abby and mikes younger brother but after william finds out he gets mad and kills mikes younger brother and after that mike stays with his mom and abby instead of gemma and darlin, just a theory

Edit: and also page 58 and the one with darlin gemma and the father could both be real because their on two differnt pages completelys and the dad script can be william trying to stop mike and abby from freeing the children and he cant leave his children home alone so he takes them with him to set up then has mikes mom who possibly not dead",UCayK1-6qH7rrf1ovjRKaC6g,rdMyaxhWQ8k

This is the opening sequence of the movie. It’s a heavily disguised William Afton and a young Vanessa (“Gemma”) in the late 80s or early 90s luring a child (“Darrin”) into the basement where he plans to unalive Darrin and stuff him into one toy animatronics or Mangle. Maybe Darrin could potentially be Garrett Schmidt and he’s about to become the Puppet?

UgyqxRMQ9B5Ja-qaYn14AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdMyaxhWQ8k&lc=UgyqxRMQ9B5Ja-qaYn14AaABAg,"Script 4 makes the most sense with the given evidence we have so far, FNAF 2 is the only in game OG location we see with a carousel in it. The location is also referred to as “abandoned” in the script title. Unlike FNAF 2’s location which looks relatively new and a functioning business, however FNAF 2 is also a prequel to the first game, but the next movie can’t be a prequel since it is already confirmed to be set after the first film, with Josh Hutcherson returning so unless he magically gets de-aged I can’t see the new movie being set in the past, so basically having 2 or more abandoned Freddy’s locations makes sense in this timeline. 
Also regarding the “Gemma” and “Darrin” names it’s common for screenwriters to use an anonym when writing a character who’s identity is not meant to be revealed at the time, and especially since this is Scott who we are talking about who loves his secrets and red herrings. 
Scott is another reason why I’m leaning to script 4 because as much as I like script 3 I just don’t believe Scott would reveal what seems like a very critical part of the movie in a script preview, think about all the tiny details in the games he goes so far to hide and have us theorize about. It just doesn’t seem like him to reveal something this way, that’s never been his style.
So I’m pretty confident that script 4 is our winner.",UCHN-KqnBxcW19bljcwwVngA,rdMyaxhWQ8k

Next likely to me seems Script 1, which seems less like a conclusion to me than setting up for a plot twist, with Vanessa being forced to ""free"" the animatronics, only for it to be revealed that they have been set free to roam and murder on their own (or something similar).

For anyone who may not fully understand the page numbering system in contrast with the film, a good rule of thumb is that every page = 1 minute of screen time.

Ugw0wLRUdT5CuixqpeB4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdMyaxhWQ8k&lc=Ugw0wLRUdT5CuixqpeB4AaABAg,"Film student here! Typically, when it comes to scripts, a general rule of thumb is one page of a script equals 1 minute in the final film, so if we're looking at the pages from a story perspective, placing them into a cohesive story... I'd say either the 3rd or 4th one flow the best, not saying that the others aren't likely either... but they do flow the best. 

For the 3rd one, Mike burning plushies in sort of a co-op mission could lead to a climax and resolution at the end of the film given it's page 58, making it around an hour mark would leave enough time for a resolution. 

Similar reasoning for the 4th one, this sequence would be early on in the film... possibly being an event from the past, which would then connect somehow to something later in the movie. 

The reason I don't think the 1st one is likely is because based on where Vanessa was left off in the first film, how likely is it that she's out of the hospital... there could be a time jump, perhaps she was watching Abby and they were kidnapped by an animatronic... but the suspense in the scene just seems too much for what would be the half hour mark in what will probably be close to a 2 hour film. 

As for the 2nd one... it's just a bit much in all honesty. This scene seems what is typically exposition, giving the audience some backstory... and it's just unusual to place this in 20 minutes in. Then again, this is Scott we're talking about... and perhaps we meet these characters earlier in the film... but I can't imagine an event taking place that would even involve the US Government with Fazbear Entertainment this early on, if at all in the franchise. 

I'm honestly happy to talk more about this too, disecting scripts is essentially what I study at school... ha!!",UCaNyZeWf2eFOglBhyw5u9Sg,rdMyaxhWQ8k

UgwU8VnQFyJJEZXGbEJ4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdMyaxhWQ8k&lc=UgwU8VnQFyJJEZXGbEJ4AaABAg,"Hii, I'm a film graduate and I have some thoughts. This will be a LONG text (1114 words lol) explaining my opinion and I apologize if there's smth hard to understand (English isn't my first language) but, in a nutshell, I think the fourth and last script is the real one bc, from a narrative standpoint, it would make a good start for the movie AND it's written correctly (although not having numbered scenes is infuriating but alas, none of the scenes in other scripts are numbered, so maybe it's a weird standard from US filming industry, idk). 

I also think that ""the man"" can't be (or at least shouldn't be) any important character unlike Darrin and Gemma. Why? Well, when you hand the script to the actors and actresses, they need to know the role they are playing, so hiding the identity of the character in a script that only the staff would read and that everyone working on it knows who the character is is unnecessary and even confusing. A script is meant to guide the actors and describe ONLY what is shown on the screen objectively. 

I agree that it's weird that a dad goes into an abandoned Freddy's and KNOWS his way around (if he didn't, he wouldn't have known that the carousel has a door that leads to a staircase and wouldn't enter it without second thoughts) so my guess is that he's an employee from Freddy's, like a technician or smth similar. As to why he'd be bringing his kids to an abandoned location? Idk, maybe William ordered him to do so (either by manipulation or intimidation) or some other reason. I can imagine lots of possibilities tbh, but we won't know until the movie comes out.

But why am I so sure it's the last one? Well, I'm not 100% sure bc the third one is also very plausible to be real, but feels weird that in minute 58 of the movie (as others said down here in the comments, the numbering system of a script is 1 page is 1 minute of the film) Mike is getting ready to kinda sneak in a guarded location, either FNAF 2 location with the toy animatronics or somewhere else. The standard length for a movie is between 1h 30 min and 2h and, assuming that the film will be at least 2h, this is happening right in the middle of the film, which feels weird bc there would be 1h more of action when this feels like the start of the climax of the movie, which actually would make a bit more sense if the movie was around 1h 30 min. However, knowing that the first movie was 1h 50 min, I HIGHLY doubt that this one will be shorter bc there's A LOT more material than in the first one (for starters, there are twice as many animatronics than in the first movie that have to be narratively presented and developed and the budget of the movie is clearly a lot higher, so there's no way it will be shorter). So yeah, the third one just feels weird timing-wise.

About the second script... Well, I won't even touch the thing about remnant and government funding the pizzaplex BUT what definitively sent me off is that it's not written correctly. It might be considered nitpicking BUT as I said before, a script has to describe the actions seen on screen objectively, so the paragraph where the men and women at the table are ""obviously surprised to hear that blah blah blah"" is NOT an objective action. It's a description of the character's thought process and/or viewer interpretation and is a basic error in script writing. A script isn't a novel and has many rules concerning it's writing, and that's one of the basic ones that any of us film students granted us an F many times when we were starting to write scripts (I used to write novels, so I obviously learned this the hard way). Also, the annotations (the brief text under the name of the character's dialogue) are incorrect bc an annotation is an indication of the emotions or expressions that a character is doing like ""(looks distressed)"" or ""(in a sad tone)"" that are meant for the actor to understand the tone of the actions and dialogue they're doing. However, all the annotations in this script are actions like ""waving a hand"" or ""thumping the paper"", which are also written incorrectly bc ALL verbs have to be in a present tense, not in gerund bc those verbs are narrative, which I've already said that it's a no-go in script writing. So yeah, if this script is the real one, I'd be disappointed MAINLY bc that script is supposed to be written by a professional, and no professional should make such basic errors.

Finally, about the first script, for starters my brain hurts while trying to understand how the action is being presented, so that says a lot. Again, it's written like if it was a novel, which I said it's a basic error, but, aside from that, the action described is weird by itself. From a timing standpoint, this happening 25 min in the movie is simply weird: it has no flow of action purpose, feels really forced and basically this should happen either at the start of the movie where the plot conflict is presented, at the start of the climax deepening the conflict (Vanessa and Abby are tricked by William/other antagonist to do smth through Toy Chica) or at the end of the movie where the conflict is solved with a weirdly happy ending that wouldn't suit this franchise at all. Also, from a lore standpoint, it feels off that Toy Chica, out of all Toy animatronics, can talk so fluidly bc I don't remember the Toy animatronics having a complex voice box. That actually would fit more to what I remember about the Funtimes with the voice luring system and stuff. However, as literally no one else called this out, not even Dawko, I'm going to assume that I have the animatronics all mixed up.

So that would be my reasoning as to why I think the last script would be the more fitting to be an actual movie script. I just wish they number the scenes bc oh boy not numbering them just makes filming REALLY complicated for everyone in the set, and I'm talking through experience. Also, if you've read all this to the end omg you are crazy and thank you so much, I hope this was as educational for you as it was infuriating to me lol ",UCsR4VemYa7VIsF1yACF2Y7A,rdMyaxhWQ8k

Honestly, tho, if I had to choose one it would probably be either the infected plushies one or the carousel.

It feels like a great opening scene of the movie and do not forget that FNaF 2 is supposed to be a prequel to the original game. So having Abby, Vanessa & Mike so early in the movie. Doesn't really make that much sense. And the mystery part of the 4th script definitely feels best, because it sets up so many questions that will or won't be solved in the rest of the movie.

And do not forget that it might have been a misremembered memory from a kid stuck inside of the withered animatronic suits. Memory can be extremely unreliable and easily manipulated. As we have seen in the first movie. So do not forget that the kids and the father could actually be totally different people. ^^;",UCDLdbyE7niGMXR6Y67JHexw,rdMyaxhWQ8k

Knowing that the fnaf 2 location did in fact have it's own killing (or at least is believed to be) from the fnaf 2 minigames, I think this makes a good motive for actually going there and having a goal rather than just being a night guard.
My theory is that in the movie universe, the toys are not haunted but will still attack them because they're quite literally criminals, breaking in and trying to set fire to the place. If there was an MCI, then Afton would've hid the bodies in the withereds since they're bigger than the toys and locked in parts and service. Or yk, have the toys also be haunted since they're made from the withereds. Either way it's interesting to think about",UCPVlL4LNSQ-pcDk60nbgLDg,rdMyaxhWQ8k

I also someone some mention what the book was, the one Abby mentioned, based on a real book it seems. Plus what bugs me about the last page is a few things. Number one, is how is there a staircase inside the carousel? With a regular size one I would understand but this carousel is inside a building so it can’t be too huge, as least not big enough for a staircase to fit in the middle. Another thing is the carousel characters. Ofc there the main 4, but why a gator, a wolf, and a hippo? Now you might be thinking just random animals but this is inside a Freddy’s so why those animals? Ofc we have these animals in the franchise, gator -> Monty (SB), all though that a problem because SB comes from the future, or can be a tied to the green mask kid we see in the Happiest Day(?) minigame in FNaF 3 (this will be important later). Wolf -> Twisted wolf from the books but the books, and the hippo could be a tie to another mask kid from the Happiest day minigame or Mr. Hippo but Hippo comes Pizza Sim (FNaF 6) but I remember from MatPat’s old timeline video, a theory was that the mediocre melodies are old robotics from Henry before he joined with William to make Fredbear. Now this these characters could just be an Easter egg to these characters (like they could make the wolf half broken like Twisted Wolf) but why this random assortment of characters? Some could work such as the gator tied to the mask kid or the hippo also tied with the other mask kid but also the Melodie animatronics being old theory being confirmed (at least in the movie setting).",UChhbxbUzUeacTvWZT5C48uw,rdMyaxhWQ8k

Ik cc is a boy in the games but so was Cassidy a girl so maybe they genderswapped them.

Which would mean no Abby, and no Mike unless he’s a child in the mid to late 80s. Which leads me to feeling like the 4th script is probably the real one because it has no presence of Abby or Mike. However I’m confuse on why it’d be abandoned. Unsure. 

Also if Matthew Lillard was signed on for 3 movies, he’s gotta make his appearance in this movie. I doubt it’s gonna be after the first movie cause well, he died getting spring locked. He wouldn’t come back for a long time and by then he’d be a corpse inside of what we know as springtrap. I highly doubt they’re gonna do a timejump where Mike and Abby are older and then Matthew makes his appearance. That’d be skipping fnaf 2 and going directly to fnaf 3. 

My prediction is this movie is gonna be a prequel, it’s gonna show the events of fnaf two and whatever else they’ll throw in.",UCGhXuUed5kER-KNEoGDrSjg,rdMyaxhWQ8k

I definitely think the last script page, with Gemma and Darrin and the carousel, is the real one. It feels like opening scene material, which would match the page number, and the writing just feels more realistic to something Scott would tease us with, instead of seeing our favorite characters in the midst of the action... or a government conspiracy lol.

In the first script Toy Chica speaks? Why? None of the animatronics spoke in the first movie.

The second one is absurd. Government funding Freddy's? Remnant? Come on...... this reminds me of the early scripts for the first movie were plushies take over the world or something.

The third one's alright if you innterprete it as burning everything down to release the spirits of the children, however at the end of the forst movie the entire pizzaria starts to blow up for some reasons.... I dunno I think the fire would make more sense for fnaf 3.

The fourth script reminds me of Sister location and security breach with an hidden underground area underneath the pizzeria.

Regardless of wich ones are true or not all of them certainly do raise questions in regards to an adaptation of fnaf 2. So far it dosn't really feel fnaf 2 related at all aside from maybe the first script

I'm experienced with story structure and pacing in both screenplays and novels, and the two scripts you talked about at the very end are both very likely to be the real one!

Mystery is obviously a big part of most horror movies, so the one with the dad going to the pizzeria with his kids sounds like an extremely good set up and hook. However, it feels like the first three pages would either be crammed with info, or just barren/vague and confuse people.

The other script with Mike and Abby talking about the “plushies” is probably referencing the story of the “Velveteen Rabbit” which I loved as a kid but am now disturbed by haha. The page number being in the 50’s range tells me that it is in the middle of the script (industry standard script length for most movies is around 80-120 pages, and 1 page = 1 Minute), aka where our heroes do something that will trigger the start of the final act. 

Make what you will of this, Thanks for reading!

It's usually what you're taught when script-writing, but generally 1 page of a script is equal to 1 minute screen time. The first page is just absurd. So much goes on in that scene it would feel over the top. Same with the military script. 
The page about the plushies is interesting however. It would definitely make more sense with context, maybe it's referring to a discussion the characters have already had? If something is wrong with the toy animatronics why is it up to Mike, Abby and Vanessa to fix them?
Finally, the last page. I felt like it flowed much better too, and it was a good little opening considering its only page 4. But my theory is that this little secret room is a room William created, since it seemed well hidden and not behind any ordinary staff door. I think it could have been a place he used to kill, or tamper with the animatronics in a sneaky way. 
Though god knows how this guy (I'm assuming he was a former worker) found out about it, and felt the need to bring his kids. 
Also, would it seem a bit repetitive that both films take place in an abandoned pizzeria? I'd like to think that it takes place whilst the pizzeria is still functioning, though that's unlikely....The more that I think about it, the more I believe the infected plushie script.",UC6pKhee-qbBw4Vs9rBinfGw,rdMyaxhWQ8k

And also it doesn't seem like it's too early on,I feel like it's pretty believable it's page 4,I at first thought maybe it's like the scene with the security guard in the first movie at the beginning but idk if page four is too late for that?

With the third one, it feels like something that would happen, I think the only bit that wouldn't be in the script is ""We got a job to do"" but Abby talking about that story seems in character for her and lastly while I do love the idea Dawko put forward and I can see that being the case, I also think it could be that, the bit saying the building is abandoned is the red herring, as if you take the script and change it so that its after hours, it would make sense for a  employee to take their kids there after hours to look at the animatronics up close, could possibly be a previous night guard but it definitely feels like something that would happen in the opening of the film",UCgx2tfRqr-sP2gS4ThNcilQ,rdMyaxhWQ8k

3. the story seems weird, i mean, then we gotta focus on the kid and fkashbacjs of him how it happend, etc.

i think, its the fourth one. +my theory 

4.  my theory is, when they enter down into the darkness, they could see the witherdeds starting to get active,  or maybe the witherdeds aint active, and that man needs to investegate something there, and when they want to go back above, they see the yellow rabbit behind them, pushing them down and killing them, because its probaly a flashback in an abonded building, so no one can hear them scream.

UgyiBNqjSHhp-ewUg-R4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdMyaxhWQ8k&lc=UgyiBNqjSHhp-ewUg-R4AaABAg,"I feel like the script to where on page 25 to where it says ""The grip loosens, and Vanessa watches Toy Chica look back at the computer."" I feel like that script might be real, speaking because in the first Fnaf movie, Mike was dreaming a few times in the film. So maybe the reason why this is early on, could be either Vanessa Mike dreaming about this happening, even before they go into restaurant later in the movie. Kind of like a premonition.

And the other script about the Dad taking his two kids to the abandoned restaurant. I feel that, that would probably be a part of the beginning of the film. 

I don't really have much to say about that one, but if it's not that script, then I feel that it's the first script that I mentioned.

It could also be the one to where they are talking about Scarlet Fever. I feel that it's also likely to be that one because, when Mike calls Vanessa, what if it was Mike having that dream about Chica looking at the camera, because he asks Vanessa if she has work or not? And since she says no, and he tells her to get ready, he just has a feeling or knows where another restaurant is or was built.

Mike having that dream, makes sure that nothing happens. But then what if Mike and Vanessa were both having the same dream, and once Mike tells Vanessa about his plans, she thinks that it's a bad idea.

A friend of mine pointed out that Mike is not really a person who goes into action like in that script tho, and I do agree with that. The way he talks to Vanessa was a bit strange too. Maybe not enough context?

so honestly, I think the man and the kids might be the real one! Like an opening scene (maybe flashback?) since its so early, it makes sense to  not be the main characters (like in the first movie with the guard)

If we look at the page number like Dawko said, then this would be very early in the film. Maybe like the ""introduction"" to the animatronics similar to the first movie, where nightguard guy gets killed by Foxy. The movie opens with this family, a dad and his two children, who are going into the Pizzeria for whatever reason. 

Maybe the dad is looking for something from his past, or he's into some shady dealings or something. It could be that the dad is a criminal, like he's escaped from prison or something, and he takes his unknowing children to the Pizzeria to hide out, but the Toy Animatronics with their criminal database systems attack him. This would give the audience and introduction to the Toy Animatronics, their functions, the Pizzeria itself, all without being too similar to the first movie's intro.",UCjgJtTJUDdBOq6d61DsZ_wA,rdMyaxhWQ8k

But you could be right, <br><br>I know for a fact the only carousel shown in the main line games is at the FNAF 2 location, and I don’t recall seeing one at the Freddy’s we see in the movie. However the script says “abandoned” so that would that mean there are two abandoned Freddy’s locations at this point in time? Also chronologically FNAF 2 is a prequel to the first game, but since Josh Hutcherson is confirmed to be returning it would make sense to have multiple abandon locations though since the movie will be set in the present time of the story.<br><br>Hard to wrap my head around this one but it seems like that script is the most plausible and I don’t think Scott would want to reveal a scene more than a couple minutes into the movie so I’m thinking that the script has to be the cannon one, just gotta figure out the correct lore lol",UCHN-KqnBxcW19bljcwwVngA,UgxQL2LyxAVWKss6mW14AaABAg

But it&#39;s entirely possible that he might&#39;ve just been, like, a janitor or something at this location, who knows about secret passages or maintenance access tunnels but didn&#39;t have any insight on the workings of the animatronics themselves.<br><br>And I&#39;m also doubtful about them keeping the chronological order of the games consistent with the movies. It wouldn&#39;t really make sense (narrative-wise and for the general audiences who aren&#39;t familiar with the games and the lore) to have the second movie with the same characters take place prior to the first.",UCjgJtTJUDdBOq6d61DsZ_wA,UgxQL2LyxAVWKss6mW14AaABAg

I know that sounds insane after waiting eight years for the first movie, but hear me out here. The first movie was amazing, obviously, the props and animatronics were genuinely perfect. It was more just fantastic and wonderful and magical seeing this movie come to life before our eyes, but that doesn’t mean it was without problems. The first Fnaf movie suffered from pacing and lack of horror. There were a lot of scenes that just kind of jumped back-and-forth between each other with no connective tissue, some characters seem to bland, even though they were complex, just because they didn’t have enough screen time. And of course the lack of blood makes things frustrating. The springlocks scene could’ve been so much better if we saw blood leaking out of the suit slowly. And obviously blood doesn’t equal horror, so, having more shots of the animatronics stalking the protagonists from the background in the darkness is necessary, keep them creepy, elevating dread to another level. I am absolutely excited about this movie, I just really hope they learn from their mistakes with the first one and make the best thing they possibly can.",UCT0leaw9kKjcUq_vea5nkZw,rdMyaxhWQ8k

Page 25: As you said, it's a bit weird. Doesn't seem like a scene that would only be on page 25 of the film, and the tone seems very off.

Page 18: Most obviously fake one of the bunch. It's also a reference too one of the failed concepts for the first movie that scott told us about. Something regarding the army using Fazbear technology in the military or something.

Page 58: Def the 2nd most convincing one, however still probably fake. It seems like yet another reference to a failed concept, this one being the infamous ""plushies take manhattan"" pitch from years ago. Also Mike's line at the end doesn't seem in character for him. But your thoughts on the plushie story being an analogy is a very good point.

Page 4: Makes the most sense. This seems like a cold open to the film establishing that there was more than one location in the timeline. And the vagueness of the context of the scene makes it seem like it's real. The line ""we're not here for a ride sweetie."" shows a clear ulterior motive that would probably be set up in the next minutes of the script. Also it's the only one that references something from the actual fnaf 2 location and uses it as part of the story.

Maybe they go down the stairs into a sort of backroom type of deal, and then get cornered by the withered or the toys and killed? or springtrap may be there and kills them?
Just throwing stuff out there but could be possible.

For anyone who may not fully understand the page numbering system in contrast with the film, a good rule of thumb is that every page = 1 minute of screen time. So that would mean with the toy chica page, that whole thing would've happened loosely 25 minutes into the film, which would be absolutely insane in my opinion.

The symptoms 
sore throat, enlarged neck lymph nodes, (nausea), swollen and bumpy tongue that's red, or swollen tonsils
This explains why he's crying so much and locked in a room alone... now the crying kind in fnaf 4 is contagious and with _nausea_
Symptoms: Nausea is an uncomfortable feeling in the back of your throat or an uneasiness in your stomach.
The causes Examples include motion such as from a car and plane, (taking pills on an empty stomach), eating too much or too little, or drinking too much alcohol.

And amidst all the studies disguised as safety procedures, maybe William or Henry sneaks a remnant study in there that goes unnoticed until that scene. In general I'd also find it interesting to see if maybe they show William being removed from Fazbear Entertainment after being caught for the murders (dispite being released due to the lack of evidence from how well he hid the bodies).

Well, judging by the direction the elbow in bending to, we are looking at him from the back, not from the front, and if you visualize how it would look like from the front, you'd realize that the arm it has is its left arm and the one it's missing is its right arm, while Withered Bonnie is the exact opposite. Also, if you look into the endo's back, you can see the word ""Bonnie"" written in a light blue, so I'm pretty sure that it's Toy Bonnie's endo. And if you're wondering why it says ""W.Bonnie"" in the circular platform besides the endo, then that's because THAT's where WITHERED BONNIE'S ACTUAL ENDO will be placed",UC5nruXS7U2uR5F-n8j-efiw,rdMyaxhWQ8k

The Starliner spacesuit simply cannot fit into a seat on a Crew Dragon, as it&#39;s too bulky.  SpaceX spacesuits are more sleek and modern, if not futuristic, while Starliner spacesuits are based on traditional 20th Century designs.<br><br>As it is, NASA still prefers Starliner over Crew Dragon to this day, even though Crew Dragon has outperformed all expectations for the last several years.  So once the kinks for Starliner get worked out, I have a feeling that Starliner will become the workhorse of the Commercial Crew Program over SpaceX.<br><br>It would have been nice if NASA mandated some sort of compatibility between the two spacecraft, but I don&#39;t know if that crossed their mind.

When they merged with McDonnell Douglas, which had more bean counters on their Board of Directors than engineers, those same bean counters took over Boeing&#39;s Board of Directors, resulting in the various crises that Boeing is facing today.<br><br>But it&#39;s all to please the shareholders, sadly.  In fact, the largest shareholders for Boeing (The Vanguard Group and BlackRock, Inc., amongst others) are the same largest shareholders for Kroger (which was the company I used to work for).

All should remember that Boeing accepted AR's hardware qualification testing and production hardware because they met Boeing's corporate supply chain quality assurance requirements and specifications.

Boeing has been led by leadership over the last couple of decades that has been very cavalier about safety vs. ""the bottom line"".  They have been caught up in massive lawsuits and bad press and don't at this point need any more of that.  They want to take the chance and send the astronauts home on the Starliner, buuuut the standard risk you talk about has suddenly become a more important and concern than previous due the sudden attack of risk aversion.  I think this is the more important issue and the bad press from keeping the Astronauts up there is much less than the risk of possible catastrophe on re-entry, as long as the potential for fixing the issues and lowering the risk on the Starliner re-entry.  Boeing has not previously been too risk averse in the Aircraft safety defects dropping planes out the skies and killing thousands of people, but the consequences of that attitude have been much more severe than they have calculated and planned for in their financial spreadsheet.  Just my personal opinion!  I personally think their best outcome would be to bring the Astronauts home on Dragon and send the Starliner home by itself.  If it fails re-entry, the leadership can claim good precautionary judgement and if it survives re-entry, they can claim good judgement in not risking the Astronauts.

It is interesting that 90% of the problems of Starliner are in the propulsion systems of the service module.
I am with you Scott. I would like them to bring the crew home on Starliner and shut the mouths of all the haters.

* *[**0:00**]* *Extended Stay:* Astronauts on Starliner face a potentially much longer stay on the ISS due to ongoing technical issues. An 8-day mission could turn into an 8-month one. 
* *[**1:16**]* *Contingency Plans:* NASA has backup plans ready if Starliner can't safely return the astronauts. Options include:
    * *[**1:47**]* Sending a Dragon spacecraft with only two astronauts instead of four, bringing the Starliner crew back after 6 more months on the ISS.
    * *[**2:08**]* Utilizing the cargo pallet on the Crew-8 Dragon for astronaut return.
* *[**2:34**]* *Safety Concerns:* NASA is hesitant about clearing Starliner for re-entry due to unresolved technical issues, prioritizing astronaut safety above all else. The upcoming US election adds another layer of pressure on decision-making. 
* *[**4:57**]* *Thruster Issues:* Five maneuvering thrusters underperformed during approach to the ISS. While four are now back online, the cause remains uncertain. 
* *[**7:01**]* *Potential Cause:* Boeing believes the issue might stem from Teflon seals inside the oxidizer poppets (valves). Overheating may have caused the seals to extrude, interfering with oxidizer flow.
* *[**9:18**]* *Blame Game:* This incident might spark another dispute between Boeing and Aerojet Rocketdyne (thruster manufacturer) regarding responsibility for the technical failure.  
* *[**5:56**]* *Software Concerns:* Configuration changes made to the software for crewed flight haven't been fully tested due to Boeing's cost-cutting measures. 
* *[**11:48**]* *Future Implications:* Even if Starliner returns without crew, Boeing could push for operational status, despite the need for technical fixes. However, the limited availability of Atlas V rockets for future launches poses a significant challenge.

Then the teflon pipes began bubbling up, expanding by a good third of their size and after that, if those received even more heat, they became brittle like styrofoam. That's the reason, why teflon isn't a good sealing material when it involves heat! Better for that is the red coloured silicone, up to 350°C or the black coloured high temp silicon up to a 1000°C.

It sounds like the performance based shutdowns, might just be a bit too strict of a tolerance level. That should be pretty easy to test.  

If NASA were running this like a traditional project, you wouldn't have a contractor-subcontractor issue. NASA would just have the right corrections made as the general contract manager. Cost plus contracts solve these finger pointing issues. If designed right, the cost plus approach is the most efficient and cost effective approach.

I'm sure Boeing was focusing all efforts on software development and testing to prepare for all contingencies.🙄

In recent years, Boeing has been downplaying risks and issues in every industry it's involved in. And in every case, they've been proven ~lying~ wrong. So, bear with me, but I don't trust that 1/270 Boeing estimate.

The case of the batteries just strengthens my scepticism. They've been qualified for 45 days. Now that they are past the deadline, they had their (Boeing) industry standard solution: Issue a paper that it's not certified for a longer time. Ring any bells? How they set their own self-certification requirements to fit the delivery dates mandated by management?

It almost put the Presidential deadline in jeopardy but they came back out with a Capsule that the Astronauts would fly in.  Except for Apollo 13 it performed marvelously.  NASA needs to take a step back and look hard the Starliner and Boeing and test that spacecraft merticulously on the ground in and out of a vacuum chamber to make sure ALL components work correctly.

Same story as the Shuttle really, insufficient testing, under-funded, optimizing for cost rather than performance, and while several things happened to cause it, I place blame purely on one fact that has caused Boeing to be a shambling zombified corpse of it's former ""No such thing as a bad Boeing product"" self:
The fact is, Boeing was great for one reason. It was engineers all the way up, from the people in the drafting rooms all the way up to the board of directors. That changed at roughly the same time as Boeing acquired McDonnal-Douglas.
Now upper management is all ""bean-counter"" accountant/marketing types. They lack the education to understand the product their business produces, and so the quality and safety of that product suffers greatly for it.
They're optimizing for shareholder profits, and not for product performance.
The airplanes aren't the product anymore. The stock price is. And so if you want an airplane from Boeing and not profits from owning stock, you're going to get a sub-par product.

There's a similar reality distortion which has happened with YouTube's management decisions in the past few years (more apparent the more recent the decision was made).
Creators aren't the customer. Neither is the viewer. The ad providers are the customer, because they're the ones providing the vast majority of the income. What does that make the creators and the viewers? It makes us the product, we're cultivated and harvested like wheat, as long as we keep watching ads and keep making videos to put ads on (even if the creators themselves don't make any money on those ads).
Dark patterns everywhere you look, and I only started noticing them in late 2016. Can't find the ""block this user"" button anymore? Youtube has decided it wants you to see all the videos, even the ones you don't want to see, because the ones you don't want to see are the ones it thinks you are most likely to sit thru and comment on (and by doing so, be subjected to the ads, which pays YouTube).",UCKpfnoejLUveGNA2HQZ-xEQ,YKbDApzT1iw

Without a certified booster available except Falcon Heavy,  Starliner has no place to go after this. Considering NASA will likely demand a whole new series of tests for the revised system before certification happens, I don't expect to see Starliner in space again for as much as two years, and it might just get cancelled altogether. I think we'll see the Sierra spaceplane certified for cargo and beginning crew certifications before Starliner is back in the mix.  Heck, New Glenn might be certified before Starliner.  Maybe Boeing can get a ride on Arianne. 

And that's quite hysterical, given how Boeing bitched so hard during the COTS awards that it should be given SpaceX's money, because SpaceX and Sierra and Blue Origin were all clearly inferior companies that would never make anything that worked.  That big badass old Boeing of the Apollo days is gone.  What we're seeing is a combination of Boeing resting on its laurels and prior legacy, while their management was hollowed-out and replaced by MBA goons from the Cult of Jack Welch, who, in their holy war for shareholder value, drove out all the engineers with the institutional knowledge and skill sets and best practices.

I'm sure the guidance-package is a very large set of files (at least relative to the ISS download speeds).  And, I'm guessing here, they probably would attempt to upload it directly to the Starliner - not go to a computer on-board then kick it over to a thumbdrive and install it that way.  I'm confident that, if they go the route of having to upload it the ISS and then transfer it to spacecraft manually, they will probably have to write a program to upload and install on the ISS onboard computer that can read the Boeing guidance-package (because it's certainly formatted in a protocol that their current computers cannot understand).  No matter how they do it - the file is going to have to get transferred (after it has been written, error-checked, debugged, and formatted for transfer) over the course of hours or days and will be tying up a lot NASA and the ISS's data-transfer resources for quite some time.  Then they are going to have to repeat the process in reverse to make sure the file they sent up was received, unpacked, and installed without any corruption.  Basically, they will need to make sure the file they get back is the same file as the one they sent up and the Starliner guidance system doesn't see anything it doesn't like and spit the whole thing back out.  If they can, I imagine they want to upload directly to the Starliner via it's onboard antennas - but, between the communications going between the ISS and ground and the fact that they are hanging out in the middle of the ionosphere - they are very likely to have major interference problems if this wasn't a contingency the Boeing guys planned on.",UCqb3HhwV46wDeHnyAJtlVqQ,YKbDApzT1iw

Flight automation software should be the default configuration for any capsule.  Computers tend to be faster and more accurate.  Pilots should be there to intervene when things go wrong.

A tale of two brave souls,
Who launched from Earth to the ISS,
In their shiny Starliner,
Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams,
With dreams of space so bright,
But now they're stuck in orbit,
With no way to take flight.

The mission started out so grand,
With plans to come back home,
But troubles with their capsule,
Have left them all alone.
The station's crew is cheering,
Butch and Suni stand so tall,
They'll make the best of living,
In their floating metal hall.

No phone, no lights, no way to land,
Just the stars and endless night,
Like Robinson Crusoe in the sky,
They'll find a way to fight.

They would only get 6 flights out of it anyway.  I think NASA will be forced to require another CFT which wouldn't happen for at least a year and then if that went well 6-12 months for the first normal crew flight.  They will have to switch a few of the 6 flights to Crew Dragon to stay on track leaving only 4 flights.  I think Boeing will pull out since they are hemorrhaging money and can't recover it with just 4 flights.

Aboard a tiny ship.

One astronaut was a mighty man,
His partner brave and sure.
The two of them took off that day
For eight days as their tour, eight days as their tour.

The capsule started started breaking down,
Despite its great, great cost,
If not for the courage of the fearless crew
Starliner would be lost, Starliner would be lost.

Now this is the tale of our astronauts,
They're here for a long, long time,
They'll have to make the best of things,
It's an uphill climb.",UCSEkSjL6HZL6E2mhohZnkZg,YKbDApzT1iw

Seems there should  be better backup options for primary capsule failures. Every capsule could potentially have severe failures. Especially with a new capsule that could go through teething phase.

It is quite clear that Starliner is better than its current reputation and that a decision in favor of the safety of astronauts and decision makers on Earth is not a judgment on Starliner. It is clear that Boeing engineers approach the matter a little differently than others. However, the press conference made it clear that NASA remains committed to Starliner and that a decision in favor of safety would not be a final verdict. Space is hard and complicated.

This mission is a PR disaster of the first magnitude and has finished any chance of Starliner being seen as a successful project for Boeing and NASA.
In fact this failure works in Boeing’s favor as they’re being soaked for billions in cost overruns which come out of their own pockets.
Cancelling Starliner in fact works for their balance sheet, which is the only thing their management cares about.
After years of delays and screwups it’s time for someone at NASA to stand up and declare this project a failure and move on to giving someone else a chance like Sierra Space.

Boeing’s reputation has been permanently damaged, nobody is going to trust them with multi-billion dollar, time sensitive, mission critical projects from now on.

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,
A tale of a fateful trip
That started from this tropic space port
Aboard this tiny ship.

The Commander was an experienced astronaut,
The pilot brave and sure.
No passengers launched that day
For an eight day tour, an eight day tour.

The approach stated getting rough,
The tiny ship had faults,
If not for the skill of the fearless crew
The Starliner would be lost, the Starliner would be lost.

The ship docked hard with the ISS for their now unknown stay
With Butch Wilmore
Suni Williams too,
The Russians and all the rest

NASA and Boeing, will make suggestions for changes (based on their experts experience) to the proposed design with ""action items"" that have to be completed by the builder before manufacture of the component can start. The builder then manufactures the ""First Article or Pathfinder"" component which then is tested to the customer's requirements.  The results of the testing are then reviewed again by NASA and Boeing at a CDR (Critical Design Review).  The contractor is usually given another ""action item"" burn-down list to complete before any ""Production Parts"" can be manufactured.  In the case of any of the working components on Starliner, NASA, Boeing and the supplier were all in agreement before production of any Doghouse Components were ever built.  Usually the testing regimen far exceeds whatever expected operating conditions during a nominal flight usually by a multiple factor. In this case it sounds like the environmental testing that did occur, did not expose this weakness in the system.

No doubt the Space-X capsule exploding is still a huge issue, but I am not sure I would equate them the same way.
I have no doubt they will ask to be certified for flight, but NASA would be stupid to do so (especially with all the publicity).  I think the biggest thing for me, is not that the seals are bad, things go wrong as long as it is fixed it should be ok.  It is that Boeing has shown time and time again that they are incapable of managing a large project properly.  The fact that Boeing will likely blame Aerojet is EXACTLY why NASA needs to slow their roll with Starliner and make doubly sure that everything is working before proceeding.  It is clear that Boeing is not doing their due diligence when it comes to being a lead project manager (*cough* 737 MAX *cough*).",UCzoB8qcEvSBEXa7ryDCYHFg,YKbDApzT1iw

The Shuttle was a problem prone design, because the better option, putting the glider on top of a rocket as SpaceX does now, was impossible back then. The european Hermes design was much better structure wise, but the glider was much smaller and there was no way to reach the transport capability of the Shuttle this way.

So the main sacrifice is the loss of a docking port and due to the extra drag ISS may need a reboost more often. Where is the Cygnus docked? Is that not another usable docking port on the US side?

Boy, was I wrong.<br><br>First off, the delivery. I get it, shipping rocket boosters isn&#39;t exactly the same as delivering a pair of socks, but three weeks? Really? By the time these showed up, I could have walked to the moon and back.<br><br>Unpacking these things was like opening the box to a new IKEA bookshelf, except instead of missing screws, I was missing crucial ignition components. I’m pretty sure I ordered boosters, not an expensive lawn ornament.<br><br>Once I managed to get them assembled (thanks to a few &quot;how-to&quot; videos from 12-year-old rocket enthusiasts on YouTube), I fired them up. Or at least I tried to. After a series of loud sputters and more smoke than a 90s grunge concert, they finally kicked in. The &quot;boost&quot; was more of a gentle nudge. Imagine getting a push on a swing from a toddler—yeah, that’s the kind of &quot;thrust&quot; we’re talking about.<br><br>And let’s talk about noise. If you ever wanted to simulate living next to a jet engine test facility, these are perfect. My neighbors are thrilled. I’m now known as the &quot;weird rocket guy&quot; in the neighborhood. Great.<br><br>The final straw? These things consume fuel like a college kid consumes ramen. I had to make five trips to the gas station just to keep them running for an hour. Not exactly economical for my great escape plans.<br><br>Overall, these boosters are more trouble than they&#39;re worth.

Although I assume it is pretty much entirely Boeing engineers who are working on investigating the issues and coming up with potential fixes I assume that it is NASAstaff, staff who otherwise would have been working on other stuff, who are having to pull together these various contingency options such as bringing back the astronauts using the Crew 8 cargo area or only launching 2 astronauts on Crew 9 to enable the Starliner astronaut return (and who knows what other options took time to evaluate and then reject). And then there's the general disruption to the ISS schedule, again presumably requiring NASA to allocate its own resource to plan around those disruptions, something that wouldn't have been necessary had this Starliner mission not gone so far off its mission plan.

Basically I'm thinking there must be a load of consequential losses to NASA as a result of this Starliner failure and I really hope that NASA is going to be able to come after Boeing for compensation for disruption to its other activities once everyone is safe. I fear though that there might be specific wording in the Starliner contract precluding any Boeing liability for NASA consequential losses but I hope I'm wrong.",UCpip7lpDyDMg0UqkhzXjxEw,YKbDApzT1iw

On the other hand, this puts Butch and Suni in greater danger later in the mission if thruster failures prevent successful reentry.

I am certain Rubio&#39;s wife Deborah was not amused!

The Axiom capsule could get them back home in October 2024 instead of March 2025.  The Axiom-4 capsule will be carrying a minimum of cargo because it is not a regular NASA resupply mission, which would permit sending up two extra SpaceX seats and two SpaceX spacesuits tailored to Butch and Suni.  There just isn&#39;t time between now and the launch of Crew-9 to make any changes in the configuration but the two months between now and the Axiom launch should be entirely adequate.  Also the Trashliner <b>must</b> be removed from the ISS <b>before</b> Crew-9 arrives because the Trashliner is occupying one of the two docking ports that are the SpaceX contribution to the ISS.  The two other ports on the US side of the ISS are the original ports used by the Space Transportation System (STS aka Shuttle) and are now three decades old and used only by the Cygnus and Cargo Dragon supply capsules.

Care you point one of these senior engineers out?  Help me to understand: who <i>exactly</i> are you talking about, who was an unqualified hire in the last two years, who is contributing to this crisis?<br><br>Boeing&#39;s DEI program was a marketing campaign that began in 2021.  There are no DEI hires.  You fell for the marketing campaign.<br><br>The management is just incompetent, full stop.  That&#39;s it.  There&#39;s no conspiracy.  They&#39;re incompetent largely because, once Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas, they had a monopoly on US civil aviation.  They had no competitors.  Monopolies do not need to innovate.  They do not need to provide a better value to their customers.  They instead spend their time and energy on maintaining their market dominance, and using that dominance to wring money out of everyone else.<br><br>The company has been mismanaged for twenty years straight.  Blaming DEI makes no logical sense.  Senior engineers were writing ominous warnings about Boeing&#39;s eroding safety culture back in 2012, after Boeing had outsourced critical engineering work to &#39;oversea design centers,&#39; where engineers could be paid a third of the wages (or less).  This had predicable results, but Boeing had enough momentum that it pulled through.<br><br>If you can find a single whistleblower or engineer who says &quot;Boeing has all these incompetent DEI hires that lacing their engineering department,&quot; then I&#39;ll eat my shoe.

We are sisters, Julia and Anastasia Vanderbyl. A few years ago, we began a journey to live a life in perfect harmony with nature. A life of caring for animals, growing fruit, planting trees, gardening, cooking, creating, building and learning to live with the land. 
In this time, nature has taught us more than we could have ever imagined.


Our environmental films document the landscape, the lessons we’ve learnt and our work as regenerative farmers here on Bundjalung Country. 


We live on the land of the Arakwal and Minjungbal People of the Bundjalung Nation. We acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the Country we live on and recognise their continuing connection to the land and waters. We thank them for protecting this rainforest and its ecosystems since time immemorial.

Be observant at all times so you don’t accidentally step on a snake or walk into a spider’s web. Most of the orb-weaving web-dwelling spiders are relatively harmless to humans anyway and simply will try to escape from the monster that has just smashed through their web. With snakes in particular, unless they are cornered they will avoid those noisy humans by moving away quickly to a safer spot, so usually you never see them. You might see them or hear them moving away so, if you do, just stop and stand still for a while and let them go. Don’t corner them! It’s always safer for humans to follow existing paths and tracks through the bush, rather than just bashing through. Also, never ever pick up anything without first turning it over and inspecting it (and the ground underneath it) for snakes and spiders, just like Anastasia did with that log. If any creepy crawlies are found, move away from them carefully and leave them alone. Give them time to move away and allow them to hide again away from that noisy, frightening, interfering human.",UC-3z9IGTztH6sNIqW_hmq4A,UgysFBdhUxwzQ742_N14AaABAg
